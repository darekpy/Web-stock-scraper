# Web-stock-scraper
The idea for the project arose due to my previous position at work, where I was looking for replacements for electronic components if some were out of stock.
The application scrapes current stock information of any inputed name and saves it into a database. At the end app updates stock of all previously inserted parts and prints out the difference.
